Ethics
===================

Types of Errors
-----------------
Accuarcy does not always tell the whole story.
Think about the ramifications of different types of errors (Type I & II) from the model, and tune accordingly.


Hidden Biases
-----------------
Biases based on past data will be reflected in the model.
Eg., job applicant being hired could be done based on gender, race, age.


Is it Better than a Human?
----------------------------------
Do not oversell the model capabilities.
Eg. A model can predict cancer from a mammogram, 
but a doctor should always be there to verify the result.


Model used for Unintended Purposes
-----------------------------------
The user might end up using your model for other purposes that might be unethical or wrong.
